I’m **Andrés**, passionate about low-level computing, from **compilers** to high-performance systems. I specialize in programming languages like **C++** and have a deep interest in compiler back-ends, especially with LLVM. With experience in **cloud computing**, particularly AWS, I enjoy exploring ways to optimize and scale software.

**Machine learning** is another area I’m deeply involved in, having built algorithms from scratch, inspired by Fast.ai and Andrej Karpathy. I’ve recently completed my thesis, where I developed a signal processing web application for neuroscience analysis in C++
